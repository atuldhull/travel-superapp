### [IV.19.1] — Install System Rules + progress scaffolding
**Date:** 2026-04-18 · **Status:** DONE · **Kind:** Build · **Playbook §** 19.1

**What was done**
- Initialised the git repository on `main` (folder was not previously tracked).
- Added a root `.gitignore` covering Node/pnpm/Turbo, env files, editor, RN/Expo, Python, Prisma.
- Created `CLAUDE.md` at repo root with the full Part 0 System Rules from the prompt archive. This is auto-loaded by Claude Code and codifies the hard constraints, output format, self-check list, tool hints, and the per-prompt execution workflow this project is using.
- Created `docs/agent-contract.md` with the first acknowledgement entry so future seed prompts have a place to record agent agreements.
- Created this `PROGRESS.md` as the rolling execution log.

**Files created**
- `.gitignore`
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `docs/agent-contract.md`
- `PROGRESS.md`

**Files edited** — none.

**Dependencies added** — none (no code yet).

**Verification**
- `CLAUDE.md` exists at repo root with all 13 hard constraints.
- `docs/agent-contract.md` exists with the [IV.19.1] acknowledgement.
- `git status` clean after commit.

**Acceptance criteria (from prompt)**
- ✅ Claude Code reads the rules on every session start — CLAUDE.md present at repo root.
- ✅ `docs/agent-contract.md` collecting acknowledgements — created with first entry.

**Notes**
- No code artefacts yet — this is a docs/config prompt only, so no typecheck/lint/test retest was applicable.
- Next natural prompts to consider (pick one):
  - `[I.1.1]` — Context confirmation (seed, no code).
  - `[II.10.0]` — Monorepo scaffold (first real code; large).
  - `[IV.19.2]`/`[IV.19.3]`/`[IV.19.4]` — rest of the meta-layer (context-carry doc, end-prompt command, stop-hook).

**Commit** — see git log.
